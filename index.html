            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">Cosmology</a> is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: <em>scientific, religious and
                philosophical.</em>. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and philosophical systems have a cosmology. When cosmology is used without a qualifier,
            it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

        <h3>Physical Cosmology</h3>
        <p>
            Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In physical cosmology,
            the term cosmos is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular spacetime continuum within a (postulated) multiverse. <strong>Our particular cosmos, the observable
            universe, is generally capitalized as the Cosmos.</strong>
